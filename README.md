WUFC Trading Competition
Introduction
Welcome to the WUFC Trading Competition! This event is designed to challenge your ability to develop and implement market-making strategies while optimizing risk-adjusted returns.

Your goal is to maximize the Sharpe ratio, which measures risk-adjusted performance.
Sharpe Ratio = (Mean Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation of Returns
This incentives stable profits rather than large swings.

Getting Started
1. Installation Requirements
Before running the competition framework, ensure you have Python installed. Additionally, install the required external libraries using:
pip install Flask
pip install numpy

2. Setting Up Your Trading Bot
To participate, write your trading algorithm in competitor_template.py. This script should contain the logic for your market-making strategy.
Your bot should respond dynamically to market conditions and adjust bid/ask prices accordingly. You should also be aware of different volatility conditions and have your bot adjust as necessary.

4. Running the Simulation
Once your trading bot is ready, launch the competition framework by running the app.py file.

After running this file, the terminal will output a local URL (something like http://127.0.0.1:8081/). Click on the provided link to open the user interface for the project.


Good luck everyone and happy trading!
